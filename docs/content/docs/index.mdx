## Privacy Header

A privacy-focused browser extension for granular HTTP header manipulation. It leverages the modern `declarativeNetRequest` API to modify headers securely and efficiently without reading your request data.

### Features

- **Profile Management**: Create, edit, and toggle multiple header modification profiles.
- **Regex Targeting**: Apply modifications only to specific domains or URLs using powerful regex patterns.
- **Dynamic Header Operations**:
  - **Set/Replace**: Override existing headers.
  - **Append**: Safely add multiple values (e.g., for `Cookie` or `Accept` headers).
- **Privacy First**: Uses your browser's native filtering engine - your request data stays in the browser and is never read by the extension.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Shadcn/UI components.
