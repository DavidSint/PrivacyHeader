## Managing Profiles

Privacy Header allows you to organize your header modifications into **Profiles**. Each profile can contain a set of headers and rules that apply to specific websites.

### Creating a Profile

1. Open the extension popup.
2. Click on the **"+ New Profile"** button to create a new profile.
3. Give your profile a descriptive name (e.g., "Testing Headers", "Privacy Mode").

### Active vs. Inactive Profiles

You can toggle profiles on and off:

- **Active**: The rules defined in this profile will be applied to your network requests.
- **Inactive**: The rules are ignored.

This allows you to quickly switch between different testing environments or privacy settings without deleting your configuration.
